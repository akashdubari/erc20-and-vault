**ERC20 and Vault Contracts README**

This repository contains Ethereum smart contracts for ERC20 tokens and a Vault contract designed to securely store and manage these tokens. Below is a brief overview of each contract and instructions for usage.

### ERC20 Contract

**Description:**
The ERC20 contract implements the ERC20 standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides basic functionalities such as transferring tokens, approving spending on behalf of others, and querying token balances.

**Usage:**
1. Deploy the ERC20 contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Initialize the contract with the token name, symbol, total supply, and decimals.
3. Utilize the provided functions such as `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, and `balanceOf` to interact with the token.

### Vault Contract

**Description:**
The Vault contract acts as a secure storage and management solution for ERC20 tokens. It implements features like depositing tokens into the vault, withdrawing tokens from the vault, and allowing only authorized users to access specific functionalities.

**Usage:**
1. Deploy the Vault contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Initialize the Vault contract with the address of the ERC20 token contract.
3. Use the `deposit` function to transfer tokens into the vault.
4. Use the `withdraw` function to retrieve tokens from the vault.
5. Optionally, utilize access control mechanisms to restrict access to certain functions.
